There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [Angular](https://angular.io/) 9 and [MSAL-Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular) 1.0.

Check it out: [ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-aspnetcore-webapi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-aspnetcore-webapi)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
