## Introduction

The MSAL preview library for JavaScript gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) by supporting [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. This sample us a JavaScript Single Page with an ASP.NET backend. It demonstrates all the normal lifecycles your application should experience, including:

* How to get a token
* How to refresh a token
* How to call a backend Web API
* How to sign a user out of your application

## Prerequisites

To use this sample, you will need :
* Visual Studio 2015 or later
* Either a [Microsoft account](https://www.outlook.com) or [Office 365 for business account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_Office365Account)

## Register the application

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to register an application.

1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

1.  From the left hand navigation pane, choose **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Click on **[App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908)** and choose **New registration**.

1. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter a name for your application.

1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.

1. Select the **Web** platform under the **Redirect URI** section and set the value to `https://localhost:44302/`.

1. When finished, select **Register**.  On the app **Overview** page, note down the **Application ID** value.

1. This quickstart requires the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled. In the left-hand navigation pane of the registered application, select **Authentication**.

1. In **Advanced settings**, under **Implicit grant**, enable both **ID tokens** and **Access tokens** checkboxes. ID tokens and Access tokens are required since this app needs to sign in users and call an API.

1. Select **Save**.

## Build and run the sample

1. Download or clone the repository for this sample.

1. Using your favorite IDE, open **app.js** in *App/scripts*.

1. Replace the **clientId** GUID  with the application ID of your registered Azure application that you pasted in the clipboard.

1. open **Web.config** in the root of the application.

1. Replace the value of the  **Ida::Audience** application setting with the application ID of your registered Azure application (same GUID that you pasted to the clipboard). Note that **Ida::Tenant** is not currently set in the **Web.config** as all Microsoft identity platform web APIs are currently multi-tenant.

1. Run the application in Visual Studio, for choose, from the toolback under the main menubar, which browser to use and use the Debug | *Start without debugging* command. The browser opens, navigating to `http://localhost:44302`.

1. When the page gets displayed, click on the **Login** button.

1. When the popup window appears, sign-in with your personal or work or school account and grant the requested permissions.

1. Click on User to see information about the Signed-in user, and TodoList to edit the todo list (you can add, delete, edit new items)


The sample was tested with Chrome, Edge and Internet Explorer. For Internet explorer, be sure to read the msal.js FAQ [Using msal.js with Internet Explorer](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/Using-msal.js-with-Internet-Explorer)


## About the code.
- The creation of the user agent application is done in [app.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2/blob/master/TodoSPA/App/Scripts/app.js#L23), configured by the clientID.

- when the user presses the login button (sign-in happens, in [app.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2/blob/master/TodoSPA/App/Scripts/app.js#L49) by a call to loginPopup().

- when the user presses Todo, the list is fetched from the ASP.NET backend. this happens in [todoListCtrl.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2/blob/master/TodoSPA/App/Scripts/Ctrls/todoListCtrl.js#L94), by attempting to call acquireTokenSilent, and then, if it fails calling acquireTokenPopup. The access token is then used to call the backend (which has the same clientID as the JavaScript front-end). This happens in [getTodoList](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2/blob/master/TodoSPA/App/Scripts/Ctrls/todoListCtrl.js#L14).

- when the user presses the logout button (sign-out happens, in [app.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi-v2/blob/master/TodoSPA/App/Scripts/app.js#L45) through a call to logout().
