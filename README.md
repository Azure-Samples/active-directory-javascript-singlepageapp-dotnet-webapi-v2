This project is similar to https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi, except that this is demonstrating how to authenticate with Azure Active Directory, Microsoft personal accounts (hotmail, outlook.com, ...), Microsoft work/school accounts, AAD B2C, and more. This is leveraging MSAL.js instead of ADAL.js.

This is work in progress.
